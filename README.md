# Star's Star's Stars Character Generator

## Foreword
This program is a program made exclusively for a homemade TTRPG system known as "Star's Star's Stars", and was made with the intent to streamline character creation.

## Instructions

This sheet does not have saving functionality presently, but will be added shortly in a later update (Pre-2025).
To begin character creation, click on the "Character Creator Tab" and follow the instructions. If your GM says you gain additional proficencies, apply those as needed. HP, AC, and Speed is automatically calculated for you as you continue through your character creation. If you wish to roll outside the sheet, and input stats into the sheet, that is possible as well.


## Limitations
Due the sheer scale that the project takes up (Over 20 classes that at minimum possess 4 subclasses each), Things have been toned down to three classes: Bounty Hunter, Monk, and Barbarian. In later editions more classses will be added.
